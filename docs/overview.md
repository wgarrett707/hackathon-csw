# OnboardAI Project Overview

## Introduction

OnboardAI is an AI-powered onboarding assistant designed to help new employees get up to speed with company processes, tools, and culture. It provides an interactive chat interface where users can ask questions and receive helpful, concise responses tailored to the company's specific context.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of OnboardAI is to streamline the onboarding process for new employees by:

1. **Providing instant answers** to common questions about company processes, tools, and culture
2. **Reducing the burden** on HR and experienced team members who would otherwise need to repeatedly answer the same questions
3. **Accelerating integration** of new team members by giving them immediate access to company knowledge
4. **Ensuring consistency** in the information provided to all new employees

## Key Features

- **Interactive AI Assistant**: A chat interface powered by OpenAI's GPT models
- **Document Management**: Admin dashboard for uploading and managing onboarding documents
- **Visual Feedback**: An animated mascot that provides visual cues about the system's state
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Responsive interface accessible from any device

## Target Audience

- **New Employees**: Primary users who need guidance during their onboarding process
- **HR Professionals**: Administrators who manage and update the knowledge base
- **Team Leads**: Who may want to add department-specific information

## Technical Summary

OnboardAI is built as a modern web application using React and TypeScript, with a responsive UI design. It leverages OpenAI's API for natural language processing capabilities and uses client-side storage (IndexedDB) for document management.
