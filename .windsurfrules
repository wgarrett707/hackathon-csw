This is a project for a hackathon, do not worry about making this work long term. It just needs to work for a demo. We are okay with just showing what the project _should_ do, not what it actually does.

You are building a B2B platform for customer/product service managers to onboard new hires (customer service reps, for instance). It will be an AI chatbot interface that makes the onboarding process easy and intuitive

Focus on making the user interface as **sexy** as possible.

The code you write and all decisions you make should be to maximize speed and iteration as this is a hackathon.
